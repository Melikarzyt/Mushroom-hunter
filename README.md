# Mushroom Hunter Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a mushroom is **edible** or **poisonous** based on its physical characteristics.  
The model is trained to ensure high sensitivity for poisonous mushrooms, minimizing the risk of misclassifying toxic mushrooms as edible.

## Tasks Completed
- Loaded and explored the Mushroom dataset  
- Preprocessed data using LabelEncoder for features and target  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Trained a Random Forest classifier  
- Adjusted probability threshold to maximize Recall for poisonous mushrooms  
- Evaluated the model using classification report and recall score
